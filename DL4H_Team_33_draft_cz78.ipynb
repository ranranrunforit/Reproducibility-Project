        "## Background of the Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Many critical tasks involve data represented in irregular domains such as 3D meshes, social networks, telecommunication networks, biological networks, and brain connectomes, which can be modeled as graphs. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle with irregular data structures, leading to the introduction of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to handle general graphs. Attention mechanisms, widely used in sequence-based tasks, offer the flexibility to focus on relevant parts of varying inputs. Graph Attention Networks (GAT) represent a significant advancement in effectively applying neural network architectures to graph-structured data, particularly in scenarios where the data does not adhere to a grid-like structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Paper Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper introduces Graph Attention Networks (GAT) as an innovative approach to processing graph-structured data using convolution-style neural networks with masked self-attentional layers. GAT enables nodes to assign varying weights to their neighbors without costly matrix operations or prior knowledge of the entire graph structure. By leveraging attention mechanisms efficiently within the graph attentional layer, GAT achieves computational efficiency and can parallelize operations across all nodes in the graph. This dynamic assignment of node importance based on relationships leads to improved information propagation and feature learning, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on node classification benchmarks. GAT offers a more effective and scalable solution for handling complex relationships in graph data.\n"

        "The model architecture for Graph Attention Networks (GAT) as proposed by Veličković et al. consists of two main model configurations, transductive learning model on Cora and Citeseer datasets, and inductive learning model on the PPI dataset. Both models are initialized using Glorot initialization and trained to minimize cross-entropy on the training nodes using the Adam SGD optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.005 for all datasets. In both cases, an early stopping strategy is employed on both the cross-entropy loss and accuracy (transductive) or micro-F1 (inductive) score on the validation nodes, with a patience of 100 epochs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For transductive learning, a two-layer GAT model is applied. The first layer consists of K = 8 attention heads computing F = 8 features each, followed by an exponential linear unit (ELU) nonlinearity. This results in a total of 64 features. The second layer is used for classification and consists of a single attention head that computes C features, where C is the number of classes, followed by a softmax activation. To address the small training set sizes, regularization is applied within the model. Specifically, L2 regularization with lambda = 0.0005 is applied during training. Additionally, dropout with p = 0.6 is applied to both layers’ inputs, as well as to the normalized attention coefficients.\n",
        "The architectural hyperparameters have been optimized on the Cora dataset and then reused for the Citeseer dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "For inductive learning, a three-layer GAT model is applied. Both of the first two layers consist of K = 4 attention heads computing F = 256 features each, followed by an ELU nonlinearity, resulting in a total of 1024 features. The final layer is used for (multi-label) classification and consists of K = 6 attention heads computing 121 features each, which are averaged and followed by a logistic sigmoid activation. In this case, the training sets are sufficiently large, and there is no need to apply L2 regularization or dropout. However, skip connections across the intermediate attentional layer have been successfully employed. A batch size of 2 graphs is utilized during training for this task.\n",

The model achieved approximately 81.25% classification accuracy on the test split of the Cora Dataset and 72.82% classification accuracy on the test split of the Citeseer Dataset. These results are consistent with the performance reported in the original paper, supporting hypotheses 1 and 2. It is important to note that the variability in results can be attributed to the randomness of the train/val/test split."
